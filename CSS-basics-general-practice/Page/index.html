        <h1>An Incredible Mixture</h1>
        <p>Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the 
            natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. 
            It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with concentrate 
            or other biological food sources, such as meat or seafood, 
            such as clam juice. Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or 
            used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, 
            as for smoothies.
