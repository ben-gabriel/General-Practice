            <div class="gridItem n2"><h1>Deserts</h1>
                <p>
                    Deserts cover more than one-fifth of the Earth's land area, and they are found on every continent. A place that receives less than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain per year is considered a desert. Deserts are part of a wider class of regions called drylands. These areas exist under a “moisture deficit,” which means they can frequently lose more moisture through evaporation than they receive from annual precipitation.<br>
                    Far from being barren wastelands, deserts are biologically rich habitats with a vast array of animals and plants that have adapted to the harsh conditions there. Some deserts are among the planet's last remaining areas of total wilderness. Yet more than one billion people, one-sixth of the Earth's population, actually live in desert regions. <br>
                    Desert animals have evolved ways to help them keep cool and use less water. Camels can go for weeks without water, and their nostrils and eyelashes can form a barrier against sand. Many desert animals, such as the fennec fox, are nocturnal, coming out to hunt only when the brutal sun has descended. Some animals, like the desert tortoise in the southwestern United States, spend much of their time underground. Most desert birds are nomadic, crisscrossing the skies in search of food. And among insects, the Namibian desert beetle can harvest fog from the air for water. Because of their very special adaptations, desert animals are extremely vulnerable to changes in their habitat.
                    Desert plants may have to go without fresh water for years at a time. Some plants have adapted to the arid climate by growing long roots that tap water from deep underground. Other plants, such as cacti, have special means of storing and conserving water.

            <div class="gridItem n3"><h1>Stars Facts</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp Stars are huge celestial bodies made mostly of hydrogen and helium
                    that produce light and heat from the churning nuclear forges inside
                    their cores. <br>
                    &nbsp Aside from our sun, the dots of light we see in the sky are all 
                    light-years from Earth. 
                    They are the building blocks of galaxies, of which there are billions
                    in the universe. <br>
                    &nbspIt’s impossible to know how many stars exist, but 
                    astronomers estimate that in our Milky Way galaxy alone, there are 
                    about 300 billion.

            <div class="gridItem n4"><h1>A star is born</h1>
                <p>
                    The life cycle of a star spans billions of years. As a general rule, the more massive the star, the shorter its life span.
                    Birth takes place inside hydrogen-based dust clouds called nebulae. Over the course of thousands of years, gravity causes pockets of dense matter inside the nebula to collapse under their own weight. One of these contracting masses of gas, known as a protostar, represents a star’s nascent phase. Because the dust in the nebulae obscures them, protostars can be difficult for astronomers to detect.
