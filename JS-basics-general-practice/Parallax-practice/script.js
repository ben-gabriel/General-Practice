// The general idea is that, on scroll down, the images whill
// start going up from the front to the back.
// starting with the flat ones, up to the mountains
// ending with the person victorious in the center as
// in the *idea* picture.
// it would be cool to add in a similar fashion to said image,
// a sun or something in that vein.
// the different layers might have to be in different colors.
